# pokeApp

This is a React app which uses Fetch API to request two JSONs of information regarding two pokemon from 'pokeapi.co'. 
It extracts the 'type' of the pokemon, from the JSON, and determines which of the two pokemon would win in a fight based solely on the types.

I hope to add a function which changes the graphic on screen to reflect the pokemon name submitted to the app.
I also hope to add functionality which incorporates the second 'type' of each pokemon, if it exists, into the 'battle' function.
